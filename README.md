PHP Slack
=========

> A lightweight PHP implementation of Slack's API.

### Provides

* Frlnc\Slack\Contracts

    A small set of contracts to allow for the consumption of the Slack API. **Interactor**, **Response** and **ResponseFactory**.

    * **Interactor** is in charge of providing the Http GET/POST methods.
    * **Response** is in charge of providing a simple Http response wrapper for holding the body, headers and status code.
    * **ResponseFactory** is in charge of providing a factory to instantiate and build the **Response**.

To use this package, it's simple. Though _please note_ that this implementation is very lightweight meaning you'll need to do some more work than usual. This package doesn't provide methods such as `Chat::postMessage(string message)`, it literally provides one method (`Commander::execute(string command, array parameters = [])`).

Here is a very simple example of using this package:
```php
<?php

// if you are in a standalone page, uncomment the following line
// include 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Frlnc\Slack\Http\SlackResponseFactory;
use Frlnc\Slack\Http\CurlInteractor;
use Frlnc\Slack\Core\Commander;

$interactor = new CurlInteractor;
$interactor->setResponseFactory(new SlackResponseFactory);

// see doc/Toekn.md for more informations
$commander = new Commander('xoxp-some-token-for-slack', $interactor);

$response = $commander->execute('chat.postMessage', [
    'channel' => '#general',
    'text'    => 'Hello, world!'
]);

$responseBody = $response->getBody();

if ($responseBody && responseBody['ok'])
{
    // Command worked
}
else
{
    // Command didn't work
}
```

Note that Commander will automatically format most inputs to Slack's requirements but attachments are not supported - you will need to manually call `$text = Commander::format($text)` to convert it.
